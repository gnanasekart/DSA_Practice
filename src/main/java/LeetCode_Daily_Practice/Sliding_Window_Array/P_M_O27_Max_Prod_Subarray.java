    Given an integer array nums, find a contiguous non-empty subarray
    within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.
The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
