    You are given an implementation of the function solution that, given an array A of N integers,
    returns the largest integer K > 0 such that both values K and -K (the opposite number) exist in array A.
    If there is no such integer, the function should return 0.

    1. Given A = [4, -4, 3, -3, 2], the function should return 4.
    2. Given A = [-2, 0, 0, -3], the function should return 0, as there is no such K > 0.
    3. Given A = [-8, 4,-6, -2, 6, 5], the function should return 6.
    4. Given A = [4], the function should return 0.

    Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

    « N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
    « each element of array A is an integer within the range [-1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000].
     */
