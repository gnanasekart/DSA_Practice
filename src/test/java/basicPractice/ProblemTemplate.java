	/*
	 1) Did I understand the problem? yes or No !!
		-> If No, Ask the person to provide more detail with example(s)
		-> If Yes, go to the next step !!
	what is the input(s)?
	what is the expected output?
	Do I have constraints to solve problem?
	Do I have all information to go to the next step!!
	How big is your test data set will be?

	2) Test Data set
		Minimum of 3 data set !! Positive, Edge, Negative
		Validate with the interviewer if data set is find by his/her assumptions

	3) Do I know how to solve it?
		Yes -  great, is there an alternate?
		No - can I break down the problem into sub problems?

	4) Ask for hint (if you do not know how to solve)

	5) Do I know alternate solutions as well?
		Yes - What are those?
		No - That is still fine, proceed to solve by what you know !!

	6) If you know alternate solutions -> find out the the 0 Notations (Performance)

		Then, explain either both are the best (depends on the time)

		Approach 1: Start with worst -> improve (Optimize) -> End up with the best
		Approach 2: Write down the options and benefits and code the best

	7) Start always with Pseudo code

	8) Implement them in the code (editor)

	9)Test against the different data set

	10) If it fails, debug them to solve it !!
